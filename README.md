# PDX Node Workshops!

This repo is for the organization and planning of workshops, meetings with a dedicated topic, volunteers, and a couple teachers. This arm of PDX Node will be aiming at helping out the beginners and intermediate node developers.


## Contributing

There is a `volunteers.md` file at root that you should add yourself to if you want to sign up to mentor workshops in general. If there is a workshop that you want to mentor in particular, add yourself to the workshop's specific `volunteers.md` file. 

Aside from mentoring during the workshops. Reviewing pull requests and going through the issues are some of the primary ways to get involved.

## Organization

Each workshop has its own directory. It will have a `readme.md` that describes the workshop, `volunteers.md` for volunteers to sign up, then any other files needed for the workshop.

Issues that pertain to a particular workshop should be tagged as such. If Github doesn't let you tag it, just mention that in the issue and we'll go through and tag it.
