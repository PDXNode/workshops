# Let's Build an IRC Bot!

This is a workshop based off the talk that Wraithan gave at PDX Node in December [link](https://github.com/wraithan/pdxnode-ircbot-talk). The idea is to make an IRC bot with some basic functionality, then just help people take it a couple steps further.

# When?

TBD

# Prequisites?

A modern version of Node installed (At least 0.10.x), basic commandline skills (creating directories, installing npm packages).
